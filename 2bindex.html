                    <h3>1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3>
                    <h2>
                        <UL>
                            <LI>AI VS ML?</LI>
                            <LI>AI = ML?</LI>

                    <H2>AI is basically exceeding or matching the capabilities of human</H2>
                    <h2>AI>=human intelligence</h2>
                    <h4>what is human intelligence?</h4>
                    <p>it involves ability to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>discover new things</li>
                            <li>infer</li>
                            <li>reason</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    </h2>
                    <p>Any system capable of simulating human intelligence and thought processes is said to have “Artificial Intelligence” (AI). The study of making systems capable of simulating human intelligence and thought processes, which comes in many forms.</p>
                    <p>AI takes many forms, like machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, etc. </p>
                    <p>Consequently, the term “AI” is increasingly used as shorthand to describe any machines that mimic our cognitive functions such as “learning” and “problem solving”.</p>

                    <img class="image" src="images/image1.png" alt="">

                    <p>Science fiction has done a fantastic job at warning us what’s to come once machines are able to think as well as humans. Fortunately, the AIs often depicted in movies are far more advanced than what technology is capable of today (or any time soon, for that matter).</p>

                    <p>While these aspirational systems — called artificial general intelligence — are far off, their’s a lot of deserved buzz around artificial narrow intelligence, or weak AI. Narrow AI focuses on one, narrow task of human intelligence, and within it, their are two branches: rule-based AI and example based AI. The former involves giving the machine rules to follow while the latter giving it examples to learn from. </p>
                    <h4>So, we come up with the Categories of AI based on our discussion:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)</li>
                        <li>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</li>
                        <li>Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <h4>Weak AI: ANI </h4>
                        <ol>
                        <li> ANI is considered “weak” AI, whereas the other two types are classified as “strong” AI.</li> 
                            <li>We define weak AI by its ability to complete a specific task, like winning a chess game or identifying a particular individual in a series of photos.</li> 
                            <li>Natural language processing and computer vision, which let companies automate tasks and underpin chatbots and virtual assistants such as Siri and Alexa, are examples of ANI.</li> 
                            <li>Computer vision is a factor in the development of self-driving cars.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>strong AI: AGI and ASI </h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Stronger forms of AI, like AGI and ASI, incorporate human behaviors more prominently, such as the ability to interpret tone and emotion.</li> 
                            <li>Strong AI is defined by its ability compared to humans.</li> 
                            <li>AGI would perform on par with another human, while ASI—also known as superintelligence—would surpass a human’s intelligence and ability.</li> <li>Neither form of Strong AI exists yet, but research in this field is ongoing.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Machine Learning (ML)</h3>
                    <p>ML is a subset of AI. machine learning involves predictions or decisons based on data. its bascially looking for predictions based upon the information that we have. so, machines learn from given data to improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. The more data you provide, the better predictions it can make.</p>
                    <h4>Types of Machine Learning:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><h4>Supervised Learning:</h4> is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset (i.e., the target or outcome variable is known). For instance, if data scientists were building a model for tornado forecasting, the input variables might include date, location, temperature, wind flow patterns and more, and the output would be the actual tornado activity recorded for those days.

                        Supervised learning is commonly used for risk assessment, image recognition, predictive analytics and fraud detection, and comprises several types of algorithms.
                        Regression Algorithms, Classification Algorithms.
                    </li>

                        <li><h4>Unsupervised Learning:</h4>It involves learning dta without labled outputs. The ALgorithm like algorithms—like Apriori, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and principal component analysis (PCA)—draw inferences from unlabeled datasets, facilitating exploratory data analysis and enabling pattern recognition and predictive modeling. ex: clustering (K-means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, probabilistic clustring).
                        <p>The most common unsupervised learning method is cluster analysis, which uses clustering algorithms to categorize data points according to value similarity (as in customer segmentation or anomaly detection). Association algorithms allow data scientists to identify associations between data objects inside large databases, facilitating data visualization and dimensionality reduction</p></li>
                        <li><h4>Reinforcement Learning:</h4>Reinforcement learning
 
                         Reinforcement learning, also called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), is a type of dynamic programming that trains algorithms using a system of reward and punishment. To deploy reinforcement learning, an agent takes actions in a specific environment to reach a predetermined goal. The agent is rewarded or penalized for its actions based on an established metric (typically points), encouraging the agent to continue good practices and discard bad ones. With repetition, the agent learns the best strategies.
                            
                        Reinforcement learning algorithms are common in video game development and are frequently used to teach robots how to replicate human tasks.</li>

                        <li>
                           <h4>Self-supervised machine learning</h4> 
 
                            Self-supervised learning (SSL) enables models to train themselves on unlabeled data, instead of requiring massive annotated and/or labeled datasets. SSL algorithms, also called predictive or pretext learning algorithms, learn one part of the input from another part, automatically generating labels and transforming unsupervised problems into supervised ones. These algorithms are especially useful for jobs like computer vision and NLP, where the volume of labeled training data needed to train models can be exceptionally large (sometimes prohibitively so).
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h4>Semi-supervised learning</h4>
 
                            The fifth type of machine learning technique offers a combination between supervised and unsupervised learning.
                            
                            Semi-supervised learning algorithms are trained on a small labeled dataset and a large unlabeled dataset, with the labeled data guiding the learning process for the larger body of unlabeled data. A semi-supervised learning model might use unsupervised learning to identify data clusters and then use supervised learning to label the clusters.
                            
                            Generative adversarial networks (GANs)—deep learning tool that generates unlabeled data by training two neural networks—are an example of semi-supervised machine learning.
                             
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Based on the amount of the data the model has generalized or learned or trained on,
                        the learning level is defined in 2 broad classes

                        Underfitting

                        Occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the
                        data.

                        Overfitting

                        Occurs when a model is too complex and captures not just the underlying
                        structure but also the noise or random fluctuations in the training data.
                    </p>
                    <p>Data is obtained through "Data Mining," and analyzed using statistical models for accurate predictions.</p>
                    <p>note: ML models can reveal valuable insights from data, but they’re prone to human and data biases. So, organizations need responsible AI practices to ensure fair and unbiased results.
