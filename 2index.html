                <p class="paragraphs">When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a while for me, but I wanted to join my friend for a non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes and I became reacquainted with the combination of fizzy water and artificial fruit syrup. Italian sodas are not as sweet as a normal soda and not as boring as flavored carbonated water. The Italian sodas at Bytes also have no cream in them, which makes it a nice coffee shop alternative for refreshing drinks without caffeine or milk.</p>
                <p class="recommendation">Recommendation: Raspberry Italian Soda</p>
